This is a fork of sekigon-gonnoc's fork of VIAL. 
(It diverges from sekigon's fork at the `bmp-vial-1.0.6` tag.)
It primarily exists to manage my customizations to sekigon's bluetooth keyboard quantizer firmware.

To keep things clean, most of the keyboards and userspace components have been stripped out.
